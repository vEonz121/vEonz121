- ðŸ”­ I'm passionate about coding and enjoy working with data, primarily using Python to build and integrate solutions.
- ðŸ‘¯ I collaborate mainly with my friends because they encourage me to turn my silly ideas into working prototypes.
- ðŸ¤” Although I love working with data, I find front-end development challenging, as design and animation are not my strong suits. Nonetheless, I'm eager to learn and -improve my skills in this area.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out to me at veonz@duck.com if you have any questions about my experience with data and analytics or just want to say hello.
### âš¡ Fun fact:
Q-learning is a form of reinforcement learning inspired by the trial-and-error learning process in animals. You can learn more about this concept in Watkins' PhD thesis on <a href=https://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/~chrisw/new_thesis.pdf>Learning from Delayed Rewards</a>.
